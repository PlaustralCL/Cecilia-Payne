              <p>
                Commenting is the process of marking content in a program such 
                that it is ignored by the Ruby interpreter. This is typically 
                used so that the programmer can write notes alongside the code 
                describing what that code does such that other humans who look 
                at the code will have a better chance of understanding the 
                code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Comments can span multiple lines, occupy a single line, or 
                be tacked onto the end of a line of code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Single line comments in a Ruby script are defined with 
                the '#' character. For example, to add a single line comment 
                to a simple script:
              </p>
              
              <code class="code--nobreak"
                ># This is a comment line - it explains that 
                the next line of code displays a welcome message print 
                "Welcome to Ruby!"</code>

              <h2>Ruby Constants</h2>
            </header>
              <p>
                A Ruby constant is used to store a value for the duration of 
                a Ruby program's execution. Constants are declared by 
                beginning the variable name with a capital letter (a common 
                convention for declaring constants is to use uppercase letters 
                for the entire name). For example:
              </p>
                <code class="code"
                >MYCONSTANT = "hello"
                  => "hello"</code>                
                <p>Unlike other programming languages, Ruby actually allows the 
                  value assigned to a constant to be changed after it has been 
                  created. The Ruby interpreter will, however, issue a 
                  warning - even though it allows the change:
                </p>
                <code class="code"
                  >MYCONSTANT = "hello2"
                  (irb):34: warning: already initialized constant MYCONSTANT
                  => "hello2"</code>

              <h2>Declaring a Variable</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              Variables are declared and assigned values by placing the 
              variable name and the value either side of the assignment 
              operator (=). For example, to assign a value of 10 to a variable 
              we will designate as "y" we would write the following:
            </p>
            <code class="code"
              >y = 10</code>
