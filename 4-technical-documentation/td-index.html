              Ruby is an object-oriented interpreted scripting language. Ruby 
              was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (more affectionately known as 
              Matz) in Japan starting in 1993. Matz essentially kept Ruby to 
              himself until 1995 when he released it to the public. Ruby 
              quickly gained a following in Matz's home country of Japan in 
              the following years, and finally gained recognition in the rest 
              of the programming world beginning in the year 2000. From that 
              point on Ruby has grown in popularity, particularly because of 
              the popularity of the Ruby on Rails web application development 
              framework.

            <p class="main__text">Why is Ruby Popular?</p>
            <ul class="main__ul">
              <li>Ruby is a very intuitive and clean programming language.</li>
              <li>Ruby a less challenging to learn than some other languages.</li>
              <li>Ruby is also a great general purpose language</li>
              <li>Ruby isextensible, enabling new functionality to be added

            <header class="main__header">Hello World
              <!-- Hello World section from https://www.learnrubyonline.org/en/Hello_World-->
            </header>
            <p class="main__text">
              One of the most basic tasks in any programming language is to 
              display information to the user. To print something to the 
              console so the user can see it, use <code>puts</code>.
            </p>
            <code class="code"
              >puts 'Hello World !!!'
              Hello World !!!
              => nil</code>
          </section>

          <section class="main-section" id="commenting">
            <header class="main__header">Commenting</header>
              <p class="main__text">
                Commenting is the process of marking content in a program such 
                that it is ignored by the Ruby interpreter. This is typically 
                used so that the programmer can write notes alongside the code 
                describing what that code does such that other humans who look 
                at the code will have a better chance of understanding the 
                code.
              </p>
              <p class="main__text">
                Comments can span multiple lines, occupy a single line, or 
                be tacked onto the end of a line of code.
              </p>
              <p class="main__text">
                Single line comments in a Ruby script are defined with 
                the '#' character. For example, to add a single line comment 
                to a simple script:
              </p>
              
              <code class="code code--nobreak"
                ># This is a comment line - it explains that 
                the next line of code displays a welcome message print 
                "Welcome to Ruby!"</code> 
          </section>

          <section class="main-section" id="ruby_constants">
            <header class="main__header">Ruby Constants</header>
              <p class="main__text">
                A Ruby constant is used to store a value for the duration of 
                a Ruby program's execution. Constants are declared by 
                beginning the variable name with a capital letter (a common 
                convention for declaring constants is to use uppercase letters 
                for the entire name). For example:
              </p>
              <code class="code"
              >MYCONSTANT = "hello"
                => "hello"</code>                
              <p class="main__text">Unlike other programming languages, Ruby actually allows the 
                value assigned to a constant to be changed after it has been 
                created. The Ruby interpreter will, however, issue a 
                warning - even though it allows the change:
              </p>
              <code class="code"
                >MYCONSTANT = "hello2"
                (irb):34: warning: already initialized constant MYCONSTANT
                => "hello2"</code>                
          </section>

          <section class="main-section" id="declaring_a_variable">
            <header class="main__header">Declaring a Variable</header>
            <p class="main__text">
              Variables are declared and assigned values by placing the 
              variable name and the value either side of the assignment 
              operator (=). For example, to assign a value of 10 to a variable 
              we will designate as "y" we would write the following:
            </p>
            <code class="code"
              >y = 10</code>
            <p class="main__text">In common with some other scripting languages, Ruby supports 
              something called parallel assignment. This is useful if you need 
              to assign values to a number of variables. One way to do this 
              would be as follows:</p>
            <code class="code"
            >a = 10
            b = 20
            c = 30
            d = 40</code>
